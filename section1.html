        As one of Seattle's oldest areas, the Central District underwent and represented immense change ever since its settlement by white colonists during the mid 1800s. Each decade often echoes its predecessors in both exploitation and development, with the area being home to vast communities as well as continued oppression. Stolen from the Duwamish and Suquamish people utilizing the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, what would become the Central District began as a major lumber yard ran by Henry Yesler. It, as well as the greater Seattle area, would struggle for several decades until the 1890s when the Northern Pacific Railway was constucted. The population began to boom, and by 1910 the population was 237,194 in all of Seattle.
