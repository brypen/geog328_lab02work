    Throughout most of its history, the Central District was predominantly native born white. However, it also served as a multicultural community and would later become the Black hub of Seattle. During its early years, however, it fostered a vibrant Jewish population along Yesler Way. By 1910, 7,000 Japanese lived within Seattle, many residing in the Central District. The Japanese population would represent the most prominent non-white ethnic group for the city for nearly half a century. Chinese, Filipino, Black, and Foreign-born whites also had signifigant populations within the area. During WWII, Japanese internment drastically reduced the Japanese population in Seattle, and its Black population grew due to wartime industry. By 1960, over 90% of the Central District's schools were Black. The population boom was due to a myriad of reasons, most notably the presence of racial restrictive covenants in other regions of Seattle as well as the abundance of relatively affordable homes in the distrct. By the 80s, gentrification had begun in the distirct, and the Black population dramatically decreased.
